      <p>
        XDRCL is a set of React components including Toggle, ComboBox, Rating, TextInput, Button, Card & Select. Many more like DatePicker, NumberInput, DropZone & Menu will come soon. As of today we hit version 1.0.0 :)

      <h3 style={{ marginTop: 40, marginBottom: 20 }}>Wait, but why yet another component library?</h3>

      <p>
        The web platform is a fantastic environment. Still it has certain limitations that are holding you back as a developer. React opened up new opportunities and I finally had tools in my hand to make the kind of UI components I always wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong. There are a ton of really great UI libraries out there like jQuery UI, Bootstrap, Polymer, you name it. They are super useful and to me often a source for inspiration. Through them I learned a lot about the details to take care of when developing user interface elements. Nevertheless always some feature was missing or the UX not as good as we imagined it. That’s why Jyoti & I started to research and explore building our own components. Quickly it became clear others might benefit from sharing our lessons learned and our endeavour shifted to creating XDRCL  - a set of configurable components with all these features included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encapsulated components</li>
        <li>Mobile support built-in</li>
        <li>ARIA Support</li>
        <li>Customizable styles / themes (right now there is XDRCL & Bootstrap 3)</li>
        <li>Advanced localized styling for each individual component</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With XDRCL we aim to provide the best possible UX while making the components highly configurable to allow users applying their own theme. For demonstration purposes XDRCL comes with two themes (XDRCL, Bootstrap3) and we aim to add more like Elemental UI or Material Design soon.
      </p>

      <div style={{ marginTop: 20, marginBottom: 40 }}>
        <p style={{ borderRadius: 2,
                    clear: 'both',
                    padding: 5,
                  }}
        >
          <span style={{ fontSize: 32, color: '#ccc' }}>“ </span>
          This is so good. I like the effort you put into tweaking the UX.
          <span style={{ fontSize: 32,
                         display: 'inline-block',
                         position: 'relative',
                         top: 26,
                         color: '#ccc',
                         left: 4, }}
          > ”</span>
        </p>
        <div style={{ marginLeft: 30 }}>
          <img
            src="images/vjeux.jpeg"
            style={{ height: 50,
            float: 'left',
            borderRadius: 50, }}
          />
          <div style={{ fontSize: 18,
                        marginLeft: 60, }}
          >

          </div>
          <div style={{ color: '#888',
                        marginLeft: 60, }}
          >

          </div>
        </div>
        <div style={{ clear: 'both' }}></div>
      </div>

      <p>Let’s have a look at two of the components and walk you through some of the details we took care of.</p>

      <h3 style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>Toggle</h3>

      <p>The handle can be grabbed and dragged on mobile as well as on desktop devices. In addition a simple tap or click also initiates switching the state. As like with the native iOS Toggle it is possible to slightly leave the bounding area while continuing to slide. In order to prevent shaky page behaviour and delayed animations is scrolling is prevented while the Toggle is active.
      </p>

      <br />

      <span>Bootstrap Styles</span><br />

      <p>
        Let’s look at another component.
      </p>

      <h3>Select</h3>

      <p>
        While the HTML native select-tag is a great component it’s styling capabilities are very limited. Adding images is not possible. That’s why we built a Select component allowing you to modify its appearance.
      </p>

      <img src="http://static.nikgraf.com/xdrcl/why-xdrcl/fancy-select.gif" style={{ height: 240 }} />

      <h4 style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>Select on Mobile</h4>

      <p>
        As promised before the Select component even works well on mobile devices. Even if scrolling is involved. You will notice that the menu will always positioned in a way that the focused Option is always visible and right above the selected one.
      </p>

      <div style={{ width: '100%' }}>
